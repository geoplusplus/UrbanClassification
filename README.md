# Urban Classification Based on Straight Line -- a simple machine learning project

I use some machine learning and image processing algorithm to build this classifier, it is able to detect urban and rural region
automatically with good results. I just got 42 (600x600) sample images for training purpose, and 20 (600x600) images for testing. 
All the images are from google maps. See more details, please read "urban_recogn.pdf"

How to run:

1. Clone this repos to your own machine
2. Nav to folder "UrbanClassification"
3. ```cmake .```, don't miss the last dot
4. ```make```
5. ```./urban_recogn```
